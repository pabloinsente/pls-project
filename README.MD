# Repo for PLS project
Repository containing the data analysis code in R from my First-Year Research Project at Psychology PhD Program at UW-Madison. Given privacy requirements I'm not allow to share the data used on my project. This repo works as sampler from my R coding and for version-control purposes. Currently I'm working on cleaning a better and more complete version of the code, the one that I used on my manuscript.
